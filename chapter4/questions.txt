//// var x string = 'string'
//// var x := 'string

What is scope and how do you determine the scope of a variable in Go?

//// The variable exists within the nearest curly braces { } (a block) including any nested curly braces (blocks), but not outside of them.
//// Similar to JavaScript

What is the difference between var and const?

//// You can never change a const

Using the example program as a starting point, write a program that converts from Fahrenheit into Celsius. (C = (F - 32) * 5/9)

//// See temperature.go

Write another program that converts from feet into meters. (1 ft = 0.3048 m)

//// See meters.go
