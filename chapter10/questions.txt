How do you specify the direction of a channel type?

// `c <- "ping"` sends and `msg := <- c` receives

Write your own Sleep function using time.After.

//
func Sleep(x int) {
    c := <- time.After(x)
}
//

What is a buffered channel? How would you create one with a capacity of 20?

// By default, channels are unbuffered, meaning that they won't send or receive values until
// both a sender and a receiver are set up.
// Buffered channels let you send values to the channel without a receiver being set up yet.
// You can make one like this: `c := make(chan int, 20)`
