Why do we use packages?

// To let us re-use and port functionality easier, and to prevent overlap of function names

What is the difference between an identifier that starts with a capital letter and one which doesnâ€™t? (Average vs average)

// An uppercase indicates that the indentifier is publicly available

What is a package alias? How do you make one?

// It allows you to reference the package with a shorter or easier-to-remember name
// You make one by specifying the alias right before the package path

We copied the average function from chapter 7 to our new package. Create Min and Max functions which find the minimum and maximum values in a slice of float64s.

// See math.go

How would you document the functions you created in #3?

// By adding comments above each function definition and running `godoc /path/to/file/math Min` and `godoc /path/to/file/math Max`
