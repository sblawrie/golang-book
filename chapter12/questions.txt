Writing a good suite of tests is not always easy, but the process of writings tests often reveals more about
a problem then you may at first realize. For example, with our Average function what happens if you
pass in an empty list ([]float64{})? How could we modify the function to return 0 in this case?

// It would throw a division by zero error.  You could check the length of the list passed as the argument
// and if it is empty, return 0

Write a series of tests for the Min and Max functions you wrote in the previous chapter.
