How do you get the memory address of a variable?

//// Use the '&' sign

How do you assign a value to a pointer?

//// By putting a * in front of it

How do you create a new pointer?

//// xPtr := new(int) would be an example

What is the value of x after running this program:

func square(x *float64) {
    *x = *x * *x
}
func main() {
    x := 1.5
    square(&x)
}

//// 2.25

Write a program that can swap two integers (x := 1; y := 2; swap(&x, &y) should give you x=2 and y=1).
