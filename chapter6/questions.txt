How do you access the 4th element of an array or slice?

//// a[3]

What is the length of a slice created using: make([]int, 3, 9)?

//// 3

Given the array:

x := [6]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"}
what would x[2:5] give you?

//// an array with {'c', 'd', 'e'}

Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:

//// See small.go
