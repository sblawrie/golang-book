What's the difference between a method and a function?

// A method targets a struct and can actually modify a value rather than copy it without having to pass it by reference

Why would you use an embedded anonymous field instead of a normal named field?

// So that you can access the methods of the embedded field directly on the struct

Add a new method to the Shape interface called perimeter which calculates the perimeter of a shape. Implement the method for Circle and Rectangle.

// See shape.go
